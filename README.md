### Core Components

- **Agent**: Advanced agent implementation supporting multiple behavior strategies and learning algorithms
- **Environment**: Abstract environment interface for embodied intelligence tasks, providing standardized interaction methods
- **Adapter**: Integration interface for different AI frameworks, supporting PyTorch, OpenVLA, etc.
- **DataManager**: Handles multimodal data streams, supporting data collection, processing, and persistence
- **Optimizer**: Provides performance optimization strategies and automatic tuning capabilities
- **Profiler**: System profiling tools for performance analysis and bottleneck detection
- **Monitor**: Real-time monitoring and analytics for system performance and agent behavior

## Installation

```bash
pip install embodyhub
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Example

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from embodyhub.core.environment import Environment
from embodyhub.adapters.pytorch_adapter import PyTorchAdapter

# Define Policy Network
class PolicyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size: int, output_size: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, output_size),
            nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
        )
    
    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.network(x)

# Create adapter and register model
adapter = PyTorchAdapter()
model = PolicyNetwork(input_size=4, output_size=2)
adapter.register_model('policy', model)
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from embodyhub.core.agent import Agent
from embodyhub.core.data_manager import DataManager
from embodyhub.core.optimizer import Optimizer

# Create agent with optimization
agent = Agent(
    adapter=adapter,
    data_manager=DataManager(),
    optimizer=Optimizer(),
    config={
        'learning_rate': 0.001,
        'gamma': 0.99,
        'batch_size': 64,
        'memory_size': 10000
    }
)

# Enable performance monitoring
agent.enable_monitoring()

# Train agent with optimization
agent.train(
    env,
    episodes=1000,
    optimize=True,
    eval_interval=100
)
```
